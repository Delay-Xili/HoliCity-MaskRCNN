    """
    Call `fast_rcnn_inference_single_image` for all images.

    Args:
        boxes (list[Tensor]): A list of Tensors of predicted class-specific or class-agnostic
            boxes for each image. Element i has shape (Ri, K * 4) if doing
            class-specific regression, or (Ri, 4) if doing class-agnostic
            regression, where Ri is the number of predicted objects for image i.
            This is compatible with the output of :meth:`FastRCNNOutputs.predict_boxes`.
        scores (list[Tensor]): A list of Tensors of predicted class scores for each image.
            Element i has shape (Ri, K + 1), where Ri is the number of predicted objects
            for image i. Compatible with the output of :meth:`FastRCNNOutputs.predict_probs`.
        image_shapes (list[tuple]): A list of (width, height) tuples for each image in the batch.
        score_thresh (float): Only return detections with a confidence score exceeding this
            threshold.
        nms_thresh (float):  The threshold to use for box non-maximum suppression. Value in [0, 1].
        topk_per_image (int): The number of top scoring detections to return. Set < 0 to return
            all detections.

    Returns:
        instances: (list[Instances]): A list of N instances, one for each image in the batch,
            that stores the topk most confidence detections.
        kept_indices: (list[Tensor]): A list of 1D tensor of length of N, each element indicates
            the corresponding boxes/scores index in [0, Ri) from the input, for image i.
